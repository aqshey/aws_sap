IAM conditions
    awssourceIP
        restrict the access to the client IP from which api calls are made.
        use case
            only your company ip address can access the AWS account and resources
            denies the access from the external users making it prefer to be used by the company employees.â€³
    awsrequestedRegion
        restrict the region the api calls are made to
        we can write an policy to restrict access on specific aws resources from specific region.
        these policy can be made to provide the government guideline based on the region.
        weather region1 follows some guidelines. weather region 2 might follow the guideline that might contradict to the region1
    ec2ResourceTag
        restrict the access based on tags
        if there are resources and their names starts with the specific pattern name then we can allow or restrict access based on the names
        it gives more granular restriction based on the correct names


IAM for S3
    bucket level permissions
        permission applies to whole bucket
    object level permissions
        object stored in bucket
        putting, reading and deleting the objects from the bucket

        policy can be made to restrict and allow access to the different resources in aws. we need to make sure which resource has to be accessed by which other resources and how it should respond while in the certain situation

IAM roles vs resource based policies

    cross account
        how to access s3 in different account
        attaching a resource based policy to resource
        or using a role as a proxy

        role
            when you assume a role, you give up your original permissions and take the permissions  assigned to the role
        resource based policy
            when using resource based policy the principal does not have to give up his permissions

        different case for EventBridge

from exam perspective

    resource based policy
        lambda
        SNA
        SQS
        Cloudwatch Logs
        API gateway

    IAM Role / identity based policy
        Kinesis Stream
        System manager run command
        ECS Task


IAM policy evaluation logic
    even thought you give a administrator access to the  user but if we provide a permission boundary to the user. then it wont allow the user to access other resources.

    use cases
        delegate responsibilities to non administrator within their permission boundaries for example create  new IAM users
        allow developers to self assign policies and manage their own permissions. while making sure that they cant escalate their privileges
        useful to restrict one specific user instead of whole account using organizations and scp
